# UFOs

## Project Summary

In this project I created a dynamic table and filter structure to be able to filter UFO sightings based date, location, and shape.

## Result

The HTML page shows the UFO sighting details and you can search by filters on the left. One thing to note is that its case sensitive. 

## Summary 

Javascript is pretty cool.
